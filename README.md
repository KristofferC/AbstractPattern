# AbstractPattern

An abstraction among pattern matching, provided with optimizations for pattern matching compilation.

## Why Optimizations

So far many implementations use **nested if-else** as the target of generating matching branches.

As a consequence, sometimes the code generation is not smart enough and could **break the type stability**.

Also, when using view patterns, it turns out to be hard to get rid of.redundant computations.

This project, is dedicated for optimizing above performance issues.
